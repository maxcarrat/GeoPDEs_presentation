  abstract = {We present the B'ezier extraction operator and isogeometric B{\'e}zier elements for non-uniform rational B-Spline (NURBS)-based isogeometric analysis. The B{\'e}zier extraction operator allows numerical integration of smooth functions to be performed on C0 B{\'e}zier elements. We show how the B{\'e}zier extraction operator is computed for NURBS. We then show that the extraction operator and B{\'e}zier elements provide an element structure for isogeometric analysis that can be easily incorporated into existing finite element codes, without any changes to element form and assembly algorithms, and standard data processing arrays. All significant changes may be implemented in a shape function subroutine. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {This contribution presents B{\'e}zier extraction of truncated hierarchical B -splines and the application of the approach to adaptive isogeometric analysis. The developed procedures allow for the implementation of hierarchical B -splines and NURBS without the need for an explicit truncation of the basis. Moreover, standard procedures of adaptive finite element analysis for error estimation and marking of elements are directly applicable due to the strict use of an element viewpoint.

Starting from a multi-level nested mesh that results from uniform h -refinement, standard B{\'e}zier extraction is applied to active elements that contribute to the hierarchical approximation. This results in a multi-level system of equations without communication between individual hierarchy levels. A hierarchical subdivision operator is developed to recover this communication by transforming the multi-level system of equations into a hierarchical system of equations. It is demonstrated that this approach implicitly defines the truncated hierarchical basis in terms of a simple matrix multiplication. In this way, the implementation effort is reduced to a minimum as shape function routines and B{\'e}zier extraction procedures remain unchanged compared to standard isogeometric analysis.

The convergence and the computational efficiency of the approach are examined in three different demonstration problems of heat conduction, linear elasticity, and the phase-field modelling of brittle fracture.},

  abstract = {The problem of constructing a normalized hierarchical basis for adaptively refined spline spaces is addressed. Multilevel representations are defined in terms of a hierarchy of basis functions, reflecting different levels of refinement. When the hierarchical model is constructed by considering an underlying sequence of bases \{$\Gamma\mathscr{l}$\}$\mathscr{l}$=0,\ldots,N-1\{$\Gamma\mathscr{l}$\}$\mathscr{l}$=0,\ldots,N-1$\backslash$\{$\backslash$Gamma \^\{$\backslash$ell \}$\backslash$\}\_\{$\backslash$ell =0,$\backslash$ldots ,N-1\} with properties analogous to classical tensor-product B-splines, we can define a set of locally supported basis functions that form a partition of unity and possess the property of coefficient preservation, i.e., they preserve the coefficients of functions represented with respect to one of the bases $\Gamma\mathscr{l}\Gamma\mathscr{l}\backslash$Gamma \^\{$\backslash$ell \}. Our construction relies on a certain truncation procedure, which eliminates the contributions of functions from finer levels in the hierarchy to coarser level ones. Consequently, the support of the original basis functions defined on coarse grids is possibly reduced according to finer levels in the hierarchy. This truncation mechanism not only decreases the overlapping of basis supports, but it also guarantees strong stability of the construction. In addition to presenting the theory for the general framework, we apply it to hierarchically refined tensor-product spline spaces, under certain reasonable assumptions on the given knot configuration.},

  abstract = {One main challenge of the h p -version of the finite element method is the high implementational complexity of the method resulting from the added need of handling hanging nodes appropriately. The multi-level h p -formulation\textendash{}recently introduced for two-dimensional applications\textendash{}aims at alleviating these difficulties without compromising the approximation quality. This is achieved by changing from the conventional refine-by-replacement approach to a refine-by-superposition idea. The current work shows that the multi-level h p -approach can be extended naturally to three-dimensional refinement without increasing the complexity of the rule set ensuring linear independence and compatibility of the shape functions. In this way, a three-dimensional h p -refinement scheme is formulated, in which hanging nodes are avoided by definition. This ease of complexity allows for a highly flexible discretization kernel featuring arbitrary irregular meshes and a continuous refinement and coarsening throughout the simulation runtime. Different numerical examples demonstrate that\textendash{}even in the presence of singularities\textendash{}this novel refinement scheme yields exponential convergence with respect to both, the number of unknowns and the computational time. It is further shown that the refinement scheme is able to capture complex solution features that demand for three-dimensional refinement patterns. The dynamic discretization properties of the approach are demonstrated by continuously refining and coarsening the mesh during the simulation runtime to keep the refinement zone local to a moving singularity. Finally, it is shown that the high approximation power of the multi-level h p -scheme also carries over to curved geometries common in engineering practice without a significant detrimental effect on the conditioning of the stiffness matrix.},

This allows us to dynamically concentrate the computational force where it is most needed.Given the segmented scan of an object to simulate, we first compute a bounding box and then recursively subdivide it where needed. The cells of this octree structure are labelled with mechanical properties based on material parameters and fill rate. An efficient physical simulation is then performed using hierarchical hexaedral finite elements. The object surface can be used for rendering and to apply boundary conditions.Compared with traditional finite element approaches, our method dramatically simplifies the task of volume meshing in order to facilitate the using of patient specific models, and increases the propagation of the deformations.},

  abstract = {We present an easy treatment of (multi-level) hanging nodes in hp -finite elements in two dimensions. Its simplicity is due to the fact that the connectivity matrices can directly be computed in a row-wise fashion. This is achieved by treating a global degree of freedom as a local degree of freedom on each element in an appropriate union of elements. This forms a type of support which is larger than the one used in the conventional approach and generalizes the recently presented multi-level hp -method. Our method requires the global degrees of freedom to be derived from tensor-product shape functions. It supports refinements of general quadrilaterals and curvilinear elements since refinements are performed on the reference element. While the method can be applied most efficiently if the subdivision leads to a paraxial subset of the reference element, also non-paraxial refinements are supported.
Numerical experiments compare the new approach with respect to accuracy and the conditioning of the resulting linear system. We conclude that this new approach achieves nearly the same properties as the conventional approach in all investigated examples and provides an excellent trade-off between implementational complexity and solvability.},
